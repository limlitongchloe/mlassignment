<h1>My Streamlit App for Machine Learning</h1>
<h4>This app allows you to test a machine learning model's abilities to predict airbnb rental prices.</h4>
<h4>This app also provides you with capabilities to conduct data exploration of the dataset as well through use of visualisations like graphs, map.</h4>
<h4>In Machine Learning Module, for this assignment, I have done much data transformation, used methods like gridsearch, to get the best performance out of many machine learning models. However, this work I have done is a continuation of my submitted work. I decided to research and explore options to get better model performance. I chose the best model from all the different machine learning models I have tested for this web app which is Bagging Regressor Model with the best set of testing and training r squared scores. For regressor problems, the higher the r squared values, the better the prediction capability of the model. The Bagging Regressor Model has satisfactory training and testing scores of 84,80 respectively. </h4>
