<h1>My Streamlit App for Machine Learning</h1>
<h4>This app allows you to test a machine learning model's abilities to predict airbnb rental prices.</h4>
<h4>This app provides capabilities for data exploration of the dataset used.</h4>
<h4>In Machine Learning Module, for this assignment, I have done much data transformation, used methods like gridsearch, to get the best performance out of many machine learning models. The model I have used for this web app is Voting Regressor Model with the best set of testing and training r squared scores.</h4>
